[Top 13 Software Engineering Trends to Watch for in 2024](https://clickup.com/blog/software-engineering-trends/)
- **AI-Powered Development**: The use of artificial intelligence tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI to assist in writing code faster and with more accuracy.
- **Low-Code/No-Code Platforms**: These platforms are revolutionizing software development by allowing non-technical users to build apps with little or no coding knowledge.
- **Serverless Computing**: Cloud computing services are advancing, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about managing servers, thus speeding up the development process.

## David Jimenez's Comments:

Some of the trends covered in this article seem to tie in somewhat to the article I chose. For example, the trend towards cloud computing services makes things simpler for many, but can also cause major problems when something goes wrong with service. Generally, it is important to look at and anticipate potential problems with these trends and new innovations while looking at all their benefits in order to prepare to deal with them efficiently in the future.
